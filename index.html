<section>
    <Div class="review intro">
        <p>The Asus Maximum Extreme is Asus's latest and best motherboard when it comes to overclocking using the Z77 chipset.</p>

        <p> Asus has always been a force to reckon with when it comes to building high end (enthusiast) pc motherboards. The <em> Asus Maximus Extreme V</em> is no exception either.</p>

        <p> As Asus says of the ROG line of motherboards.</p>

        <p> "As a hardware vendor that is in tune with the pulse of PC gamers needs and wants, ASUS is in sync with the industry. With the ASUS ROG brand, we take an active part in the global gaming community, helping develop the industry by sponsoring popular events such as QuakeCon, Dreamhack, and BlizzCon. As a result of our dedication to the gaming industry, renowned game publisher Blizzard has selected ASUS as the official hardware sponsor for two consecutive years. ASUS is proud to be an integral part of the industry and community and will continue to provide the latest hardware to enhance the gaming experience."</p>

        <p> With most high end Z77 chipset boards coming in around $400 or more the Maximus V Extreme breaks this trend by coming in below $400 with a plethora of options to suite the most hardcore overclocking enthusiast.</p></Div>

        <H3>Main Review</H3>
        <p>First of all I would like to say that I have used many different motherboards during the many years that I have been building gaming systems. One of the things that sticks out the most with this motherboard is that is was created for gamer by gamers.
        Asus ROG or Republic of Gamers products are the high end products designed for the most demanding buyer. Where it is someone who is trying to break a new overclock record or soemone who wants to have the best products for their build, ASUS ROG producst are ready to deliver.
